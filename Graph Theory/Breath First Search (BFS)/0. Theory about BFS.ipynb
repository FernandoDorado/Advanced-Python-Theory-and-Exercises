    "Breadth-First Search (BFS) is an algorithm used for traversing graphs or trees. Traversing means visiting each node of the graph. Breadth-First Search is a recursive algorithm to search all the vertices of a graph or a tree. BFS in python can be implemented by using data structures like a dictionary and lists. Breadth-First Search in tree and graph is almost the same. The only difference is that the graph may contain cycles, so we may traverse to the same node again.\n",

    "\n",
    "As breadth-first search is the process of traversing each node of the graph, a standard BFS algorithm traverses each vertex of the graph into two parts: 1) Visited 2) Not Visited. So, the purpose of the algorithm is to visit all the vertex while avoiding cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "BFS starts from a node, then it checks all the nodes at distance one from the beginning node, then it checks all the nodes at distance two, and so on. So as to recollect the nodes to be visited, BFS uses a queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps of the algorithm work as follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Start by putting any one of the graphâ€™s vertices at the back of the queue.\n",
    "2. Now take the front item of the queue and add it to the visited list.\n",
    "3. Create a list of that vertex's adjacent nodes. Add those which are not within the visited list to the rear of the queue.\n",
    "4. Keep continuing steps two and three till the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many times, a graph may contain two different disconnected parts and therefore to make sure that we have visited every vertex, we can also run the BFS algorithm at every node."
